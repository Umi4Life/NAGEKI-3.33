## FOR All the blueprint,I __didnt__ do the Screw holes, so thats mean you need use drill to creat a hold for screw,I use M3x25 screw to fix all the part.

# First
##  you need print the PCB and you need a Promicro to control.
## Promicro mini cant be used on this project!
## I already ping the ports out so you just need connect them.
## (Now you can use this brand new PCB,thats better than after and it have 4 more pin you can use for Pot and lights.)

# For main.

I recommend you use the 15 or 20mm Density wood board
### You Also can use 9mm Density wood board now,I already test for it:)

## details

For the main button,I get 67x67mm hole,thats a really big size than the button you got.But you will get the Acrylic board,that will fix the hole.
you need 60x60mm button.

for menu button,I get 50x50mm hole,same,that hold will a bit large than the button size,so you need the Acrylic board.
you nedd 44x44mm button

## NAGEKI 2.0 NEED 33x33mm button！！！

for side button,I use the 100x100mm button,thats the cheap and easy way to solve the side button problem.

## Then,you need a encoder to control the lever.
### also you need a frame to fixed encoder.
## For the lever,you can buy the wood stick or the iron stick,then you can try to use some gear or something to fixed the stick and encoder,I will post here if i get the good way to fixed them.

# For surface.
I recommend you use the UV print on the surface,I used 2mm thickness board.

Also,you can just use the Acrylic board on surface.

and you can use UV print with this pic.

# Afer everything,you will get a complete NAGEKI controller.

↑ This picture is for ver 1.0 ,ver 2.0 have a lot change here.


# When you ready for the frame,just use the arudio write the code(i already post it)

# ENJOY YOUR ONGEKI GAME :)

# ！！！attention！！！
# Im not the professional person for design and codeing,all the idea or design just form my hobby,and I never learn the pcb writing or the CAD drawing.SO the project 100% will have alot of problem,So if you find some problem or you can help me build the project better,pls email me at 2391626794@qq.com  or  Nya@nananana.net.
